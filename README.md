# Functional-dimension


This repository contains the codes corresponding to the paper *[Geometry-induced Implicit Regularization in Deep ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08269)*.


It allows to compute the batch functional dimension of a neural network, for a given list of inputs X.
